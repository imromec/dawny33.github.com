This is Sankha's website at [sankhs.com](http://sankhs.com).

This is my website and there is a distinct ~~terminal-like~~ look and feel associated with it. Feel free to fork and use it. But probably it will be better to be cool and be yourself. Modify the look and feel to adapt to your needs.

PS: The terminal templated website can be found in one of the older commits.
