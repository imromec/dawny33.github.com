    Gluing application components with JavaScript<br/><br/>

    JavaScript is a nice little language with awesome features that make it easy to learn and code in. Rather than hard-coding all the components of a software into a single language bundle, we can compartmentalize and put the core application logic in one of the mainstream languages and implement the user interfaces and API calls in JavaScript.<br/><br/>

In this talk I spoke about embedding Javascript specifically on the JVM, and similarly it can be implemented in other languages like C++. The focus will be on Java's Scripting API and Mozilla Rhino to write software components in Java and glue them with JavaScript. This will make the application components more modular and we can write easily updatable application reducing the compilation overheads. It can be used to create Javascript bindings to underlying Java code.<br/><br/>

I also spoke on how to expose simple API in your applications for end users to create scripts to customise and extend its functionality. Here I took up one of my self made applications - a media file format converter to demonstrate how simple scripts written by the user can leverage the power of the app and to do batch processing and other actions, by using its API.<br/><br/>
